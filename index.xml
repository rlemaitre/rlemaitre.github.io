In this series, as its name suggests, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about random things I learn. The purpose of all this is to make it easier for me to remember things and, of course, to share it so that others don&amp;rsquo;t struggle to find it.

Writing more and better is one of my goals this year and the blog is a fairly simple way to achieve it.
