&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After struggling a lot with my mental health (anxiety, depressive condition) for several years,
I was diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, commonly known as ADHD, at the age of 44.
This diagnosis shocked me a lot: I wasn’t a wild child, in fact, I was even a good pupil.
With the help of my therapist, I was able to understand that ADHD can take multiple forms and that it can go undiagnosed until adulthood.
Since then, I’ve been trying many technics to overcome it and make the best of it in my professional life.
This article sums up what I learned so far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TIL: Trigger a Ci Pipeline From Command Line</title><link>https://rlemaitre.com/posts/2021/03/til-trigger-a-ci-pipeline-from-command-line/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 23:10:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rlemaitre.com/posts/2021/03/til-trigger-a-ci-pipeline-from-command-line/</guid><description>&lt;p>At &lt;a href="https://adventori.com/">ADventori&lt;/a>, we use &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">Gitlab CI&lt;/a> to deploy our staging environments when code changes in our main branch.
This afternoon, I wanted to re-deploy one of our environments with the same code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One solution I saw was to add a dummy modification to our codebase (for example adding a space in a comment), commit it, and push it to our main branch.
This would trigger our CI/CD pipeline and would result to a new deployment.
This solves my problem, but the code modification is artificial.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TIL: Default Heap Configuration in OpenJDK</title><link>https://rlemaitre.com/posts/2021/02/til-default-heap-configuration-in-openjdk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 17:11:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rlemaitre.com/posts/2021/02/til-default-heap-configuration-in-openjdk/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first blog post in the &amp;ldquo;Today I learnt&amp;rdquo; (TIL) series.
In this series, as its name suggests, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about random things I learn.
The purpose of all this is to make it easier for me to remember things and, of course, to share it so that others don&amp;rsquo;t struggle to find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this afternoon, someone asked me what are the heap configuration of a docker-based tomcat.
We haven&amp;rsquo;t set any particular tomcat configuration, except for our app deployment, so the default one is used.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pragmatic Programmers on Medium</title><link>https://rlemaitre.com/posts/2021/02/pragmatic-programmers-on-medium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 22:15:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rlemaitre.com/posts/2021/02/pragmatic-programmers-on-medium/</guid><description>&lt;p>Good news! The &lt;a href="https://pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Programmers&lt;/a> are on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers">Medium&lt;/a>.
They publish there their back catalogue.
The books can be quite old, but some are still very useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The books are mainly aimed to programmers (hence their name 🙂 ), but some can interest non programming people. The full book list can be found &lt;a href="https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/directory-of-pragmatic-programmer-books-on-medium-6a5cbadbd4b4">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Writing more and better is one of my goals this year and the blog is a fairly simple way to achieve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try to write about subjects that interest me: dev, learning, ways to become more efficient (aka productivity), board games and anything else that comes into my mind that deserves to be shared.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once I decided to create this blog, once I found the subjects to write about, I had to find out how to do it.
I had several possibilities to do so:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>whoami</title><link>https://rlemaitre.com/whoami/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:21:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rlemaitre.com/whoami/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi,&lt;/p>
