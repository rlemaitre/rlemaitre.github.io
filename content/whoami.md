Hi,

I am Raphaël Lemaitre, and it appears you landed on my website.

{{< image src="/images/rlemaitre.jpeg" alt="It's me!" position="center" style="width: 50%;border-radius: 12px;" >}}

According to my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rlemaitre) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rlemaitre.com) bio, I am

> Back-end Staff Engineer @ledger.com // Pragmatic Coder // Software Craftsman //  Tech 💻 // Golf 🏌️‍♂️ // Food 🍲 and Music 🎶 enthusiast // Proud Dad

This sums up well who am I, but I'll detail a bit more.

I'm a programmer (mainly using JVM languages but not only) living in the Paris area, France.
I started working in 2000 and have worked mainly for software vendors.
You can look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/rlemaitre/) for more details.

Writing this page, I find that my twitter bio misses something: I love learning.
This is one of the main reasons I made this website (with its blog) : I found writing and sharing are the best way to learn.
To quote Andrew Hunt in <cite>[The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)</cite>:
