Hi,

I am RaphaÃ«l Lemaitre, and it appears you landed on my website.

{{< image src="/images/rlemaitre.jpeg" alt="It's me!" position="center" style="width: 50%;border-radius: 12px;" >}}

According to my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rlemaitre) bio, I am

> CTO of [@adventori](https://twitter.com/adventori); pragmatic coder; software craftsman; data lover; tech, soccer, golf, food and music enthusiast; proud dad

This sums up well who am I but I'll detail a bit more.

I'm a programmer (mainly using JVM languages but not only) living in the Paris area, France. I started working in 2000 and have work mainly for software vendors. You can look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/rlemaitre/) for more details.

Writing this page, I find that my twitter bio misses something: I love learning.
This is one of the main reasons I made this website (with its blog) : I found writing and sharing are the best way to learn.
To quote Andrew Hunt in <cite>[The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)</cite>:
