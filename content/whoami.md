According to my social media bio, I am

> Scala lover, FP enthusiast, Speaker. Creator of Pillars  , making complexity simple. Former CTO back to what I love: coding. ADHD adventurer with endless project ideas. I learn, I optimize, I build.

This sums up well who I am, but, as I'm not limited in terms of number of characters here, I'll detail a bit more:

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of exploring a variety of roles—from developer to CTO—and collaborating with incredible teams to build products that make a difference.
While leading teams was rewarding, I eventually decided to return to what I truly love: crafting elegant code and solving complex problems.

Programming, for me, is both an art and a science.
I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with Scala, designing clean, maintainable systems, and contributing to the open-source community.
Tools like Pillars, which simplify backend development, are a direct result of my passion for making things simpler and more accessible.

As a developer and lifelong learner, I believe that adaptability and knowledge are the cornerstones of growth—both personally and professionally.
In today’s rapidly changing world, this mindset is more important than ever.

Two quotes that resonate deeply with me capture this idea perfectly:

> The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.
>
> — Alvin Toffler, Future Shock (1970)

This reminds me to stay curious, embrace change, and continually evolve, whether it’s mastering new technologies or rethinking old habits.

> An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.
>
> — Benjamin Franklin, The Way to Wealth (1758)

This speaks to the value of continuous learning—not just for immediate rewards, but for the long-term growth it fosters.

When I’m not coding, I’m likely diving into my next big idea, playing golf, or tackling an escape game with friends.
As someone diagnosed with ADHD, I embrace the unique lens it gives me—fueling my creativity and drive to optimize everything, from code to everyday workflows.
It’s a journey of constant adaptation, and it keeps life interesting.
