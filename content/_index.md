Hi, I’m Raphaël, a Paris-based software engineer passionate about **Scala**, functional programming, and creating tools that simplify backend development.

Whether it’s optimizing workflows, designing open-source libraries like [**Pillars**](https://pillars.dev), or sharing insights with the community, I’m driven by curiosity and a love for solving complex challenges.
