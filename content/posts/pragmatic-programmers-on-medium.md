Good news! The [Pragmatic Programmers](https://pragprog.com/) are on [Medium](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers).
They publish there their back catalogue.
The books can be quite old, but some are still very useful.

The books are mainly aimed to programmers (hence their name ðŸ™‚ ), but some can interest non programming people. The full book list can be found [here](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/directory-of-pragmatic-programmer-books-on-medium-6a5cbadbd4b4).
