Pillars is a Scala library that simplifies the creation of REST APIs by providing a set of tools for building, testing, and documenting endpoints.
With Pillars, you can define routes, handle requests, and generate API documentation with minimal boilerplate.
Whether youâ€™re building a new API from scratch or adding features to an existing one, Pillars helps you focus on your business logic instead of infrastructure.
