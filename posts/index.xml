What is my blogging platform?</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time I wanted to have a blog.
Writing more and better is one of my goals this year and the blog is a fairly simple way to achieve it.</p>
<p>I will try to write about subjects that interest me: dev, learning, ways to become more efficient (aka productivity), board games and anything else that comes into my mind that deserves to be shared.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-my-blogging-platform">What is my blogging platform?</h2>
<p>Once I decided to create this blog, once I found the subjects to write about, I had to find out how to do it.
I had several possibilities to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write posts on <a href="https://medium.com/@rlemaitre">Medium</a></li>
<li>Write posts on <a href="https://dev.to/rlemaitre">dev.to</a></li>
<li>Hosting a blog using <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress</a></li>
<li>Use a static site generator and host it on <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/">Gitlab</a> or <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Being very attached to data protection and confidentiality (on a personal basis, I try to use as little google as possible, I will surely come back to this in a future article), I have chosen not to use a third party service as my main publication platform.
I&rsquo;m a dev, the choice of the static site generator with articles written in Markdown, and a hosting based on Git was thus naturally imposed to me.
This solution even guarantees better durability over time, <a href="https://brandur.org/fragments/graceful-degradation-time">as written by @brandur</a>.
I turned to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng">Hello Friend NG</a> theme of <a href="https://atlialp.com/">Djordje Atlialp</a>.</p>
<p>The source of this site is hosted on a <a href="https://github.com/rlemaitre/rlemaitre.github.io">Github repository</a>.
Do not hesitate to create <a href="https://github.com/rlemaitre/rlemaitre.github.io/issues">an issue</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/rlemaitre/rlemaitre.github.io/pulls">pull request</a> if you see any bug or typo.</p>
<p>As this theme allows me to have the site and the blog written in several languages, I will try to write as much as possible my articles <a href="/fr/posts/">in French</a> and <a href="/posts/">in English</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a comment system on the blog. However, because of <a href="https://supunkavinda.blog/disqus">data protection issues</a>, I didn&rsquo;t want to use disqus.
I turned to <a href="https://utteranc.es/">Utterances</a> which is open source, without any tracking and stores comments as GitHub issues.
So don&rsquo;t hesitate to comment on articles, you just need to have a GitHub account to do so.</p>
