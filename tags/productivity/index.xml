&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After struggling a lot with my mental health (anxiety, depressive condition) for several years,
I was diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, commonly known as ADHD, at the age of 44.
This diagnosis shocked me a lot: I wasn’t a wild child, in fact, I was even a good pupil.
With the help of my therapist, I was able to understand that ADHD can take multiple forms and that it can go undiagnosed until adulthood.
Since then, I’ve been trying many technics to overcome it and make the best of it in my professional life.
This article sums up what I learned so far.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
